Emergency services were engaged, which included the Cold Lake RCMP, Cold Lake Search and Rescue, and Cold Lake Bylaw. Emergency services and volunteers were actively searching for the missing female. All terrain vehicles, foot patrols and vehicular searches were utilized, along with concerned citizens who had been notified through social media. The combined efforts off all parties assisted in successfully locating the missing female.&nbsp; After several hours of searching, she was located safely in the backyard of a neighbouring residence. Corporal Sean Dutch of the Cold Lake RCMP states \u201cthe overwhelming number of volunteers from the community that assisted with the search on short notice is a testament to the tight knit community atmosphere of Cold Lake, and was&nbsp;very much&nbsp;appreciated\u201d. Cold Lake RCMP would like to take this opportunity to thank Cold Lake Search and Rescue services for their quick response and mobilization.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cold Lake RCMP and Search and Rescue locate missing woman On August 8, 2019, Cold Lake RCMP responded to a report of an elderly female who had left home and failed to return.
