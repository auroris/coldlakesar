### Make a Difference in Your Community

The Cold Lake Search and Rescue Society is always seeking dedicated volunteers from all walks of life. Whether you're interested in active search missions, logistical support, or administrative roles, there's a place for you on our team. We provide comprehensive training, including a Search and Rescue Basic Course at no cost, and Standard First Aid with CPR. Applicants must be at least 18 years old and possess reliable transportation. To apply, visit your local RCMP detachment for an application and a criminal record check form. Once completed, return them to the RCMP, and we will contact you from there.
